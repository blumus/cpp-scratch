# C++ Scratch

Small C++ programs to refresh my C++ skills.

Based on examples and notes from [Take U Forward: unordered_set in C++ STL](https://takeuforward.org/c/unordered-set-in-c-stl/).

## Build

- Using Makefiles per folder (e.g., `hello/`, `unordered-set/`, `my-unordered-set/`):
  - Build: `make -C <folder>`
  - Run: `make -C <folder> run`
  - Clean: `make -C <folder> clean`

## Repo notes

- `build/` directories are tracked as empty via `.gitkeep`; all build artifacts are ignored.
